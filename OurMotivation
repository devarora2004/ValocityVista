The journey during the whole event was full of ups and down from once almost giving up due to time constraint to actually completing the final run in 4mins 28seconds.
The fact thet we were learning so much during this project is what actually motivated us to go through those sleeplessnights, which I'm sure other teams and mentors also experienced.
It actually felt that this college was worth the struggle in high school, and we got a close preview of what our IITian journey is going to be like.
I would like to thank all the erc mentors and tl convenors for this wonderful experience we had in last few days. Even the informal interactions with you all motivated us to continue.
