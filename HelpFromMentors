The ERC Mentors were always there when we got stuck at any step while making out bot. Irrepective of time, just understanding the hour of need for us
Special Mention to TL convenor, Ved bhaiya for not only guiding us but actually helping us on ground. His knowledge about resources in TL and the entire institure was really helpful.
Mentors uploaded ESP01 codes which we couldn't have done without them.
Even during the final run and before( in IC-1) they were present for any problem, bug we faced on the day of truth.
