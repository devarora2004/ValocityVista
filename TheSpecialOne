The bot of ValocityVista team was the only bot that looked different  compared to all other teams. 
While other teams worked on just making the bot run somehow, we invested time in designing our bots prototype with Caterpillar tracks which not only made our bot sparkle above the other but was also useful in clearing obstacles.
During the accelerate final run, when teams kept their bots one after another, we felt it was difficult for the other teams to recognise which bot is their, since most of then had a replica except ours.
For the standard bots, all resources were available in the TL itself, but we had to go out to get stuff like The Tracks, Special tyres, A different Chassis.
